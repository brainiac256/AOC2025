        None of my own code (mostly). Tweaked nkast's sample page to get arbitrary canvas placement working, but aside from that, everything is lifted from
        <MudLink Href="https://github.com/nkast/Wasm/tree/main/Samples/Boids">nkast's Boids demo.</MudLink> The mouse tracking after resize might still be a little wonky, due to the
        auto closing of the MudBlazor sidebar at a certain flexbox breakpoint, which changes the absolute position of the canvas without notifying the window. So I've locked the menu
        drawer in the open position instead of going for a truly responsive design. Oh well.

        Things I did change: I added a couple of frame lines to indicate the limit of the canvas and the limit of the area the boids would turn from, as well as added an animated
        mouse locator. Wave your mouse over the Canvas area below to see the boids in action.
